        This method is used to compute the foreign debit and foreign credit of the line_ids field
        (journal entries) based on certain parameters.

        As each product line of the invoice lines has an equivalent in the journal entries, the
        foreign debit and foreign credit of the journal entries that corresponds to each invoice
        line will be the foreign subtotal of its equivalent product line.

        The tax lines of the journal entries does not have an equivalent on the invoice lines, so
        the foreign debit and foreign credit of the journal entries that corresponds to each tax
        will be the sum of the foreign subtotal of the lines from which the tax line is computed
        multiplied by the tax rate.

        When the entry has a payable or receivable account, the foreign debit and foreign credit
        will be the sum of the foreign credit or the foreign credit of all the other entries
        (line_ids) of the move (if the line has debit it will be the sum of the foreign credits,
        if it has credit it will be the sum of the foreign debits).

        If none of this is true and the currency of the journal entry is the same as the foreign
        currency of the company, the currency amount will be the one used to set the foreign debit
        or foreign credit on the corresponding line.

        And if there are two lines and one of them is in foreign currency, the amount placed in
        amount in currency will be placed in both corresponding lines in foreign debit and credit.

        If all the lines are made in the alternate currency, it will take the amount in amount in
        currency

        If the adjustment is placed, it overwrites both lines so that they are the same amount

        Ohterwise, if the move is not an invoice the foreign debit and foreign credit will be the
        debit and credit of the line multiplied by the inverse rate.

        In any case, if the foreign debit or foreign credit adjustments are set, the foreign debit
        and foreign credit will be the foreign debit or foreign credit adjustments.
